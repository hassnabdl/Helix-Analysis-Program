# Interdisciplinary Project

## Presentation

Python code for analyzing molecules, using the model of deformable molecular cylinders.

Loosely based on the exhaustive and polyvalent program Simulaid by Mihaly Mezei (*Simulaid: a simulation facilitator and analysis program, 2010*).

Work done in a team of 4 for second year biological engineering project.

## Folders

Our final code is in the folder src.

Our trials are dispatched between other folders.

## Flowchart

A flowchart of the whole program can be found.

## Workflow

The program has the following workflow:
- DSSP
- Inertia Axis
- Turn Per Residue
- Helices Length
- Center of Mass
