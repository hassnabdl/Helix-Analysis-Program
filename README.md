# Interdisciplinary Project
Python code for analyzing molecules, using the model of deformable molecular cylinders.

Loosely based on the exhaustive and polyvalent program Simulaid by Mihaly Mezei (Simulaid: a simulation facilitator and analysis program, 2010).

Work done in a team of 4 for second year biological engineering project.
