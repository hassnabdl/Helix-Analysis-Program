# Interdisciplinary Project

## Presentation


Proteins are essential components for life. There 
Python code for analyzing molecules, using the model of deformable molecular cylinders.

Loosely based on the exhaustive and polyvalent program Simulaid by Mihaly Mezei (*Simulaid: a simulation facilitator and analysis program, 2010*).

Work done in a team of 4 for second year biological engineering project.

## Functions
